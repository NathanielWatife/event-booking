- View available tickets and waiting list status.
- Store order details in an SQLite database.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: SQLite
- Testing: Jest, Supertest
- Tools: Postman (for API testing)

## Setup and Installation
- Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

Design Choices
In-Memory Storage: Used a Map to store event data for fast access and concurrency handling.
Concurrency Handling: Used asynchronous programming and atomic operations to avoid race conditions.
Modular Code: Separated concerns into controllers, services, and models for better maintainability.
Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error handling for edge cases (e.g., invalid event ID, sold-out tickets).
Testing: Used Jest and Supertest for unit and integration testing.
Testing
Unit Tests: Tested individual methods in eventService.js.
Integration Tests: Tested API endpoints using Supertest.
Test Coverage: Achieved 80%+ test coverage.

Run Tests
```
npm test
```
Error Handling
Invalid Event ID: Returns 404 Not Found with a message: Event not found.

```
Sold-Out Tickets: Returns 200 OK with a message: {"status": "waiting", "userId": "user1"}.
```


Invalid Request Body: Returns 400 Bad Request with a message: Invalid input.

Performance and Scalability
In-Memory Storage: Provides fast access but is not persistent. 
Concurrency Handling: Ensures thread-safety for booking and cancellation operations.

Scalability: The system can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
